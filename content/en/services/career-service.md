# Career Service

Sapienza offers a good number of services to help students in entering the labour market. See the site [Career Service per studenti e laureati](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina/career-service-studenti-e-laureati) for further informations.

## Jobteaser

Jobteaser is the platform of career guidance chosen by Sapienza, with offers reserved to its students. You can create an account [here](http://uniroma1.jobteaser.com/) using Infostud credentials and start exploring working opportunities using personalized filters. In particalur, in the reserved area you can compile your reasech criteria (interest area, type of contract...) and take vocational and guidance tests, in order to ease the research. Once you have done this, explore the area "Offers" in the site to find an opportunity and apply for it. In order to better the chances of being selected, it is recommended to upload on your profile the Curriculum Vitae and specify your educational experience. Finally, you can activate the option "I am interested in new opportunities": Jobteaser will link you with offers related to your interests, sending you a message when a recruiter selects you for an interview.
Furthermore:
- the section "Events" allows you to subscribe to seminar and workshops on the labour market in order to help you to move the first steps in this world. We underline the Employability Lab, an annual event for undergraduate and graduate students to better self conscience of strenghts and interests
- the section "Companies" offers recommendations and information specific to partner companies, in order to better your chances of being selected
- the section "Appointments" allows you to book an interview with an expert for career guidance, skill balance or CV check
