# Sapienza Wireless
Sapienza offers two wireless networks to undergraduate, graduate and PhD students, researchers, professors and administrative staffers: Sapienza and Eduroam. Both allow a fast internet connection, but they are indeed very different.

## Sapienza Wi-Fi
__Sapienza Wi-Fi__ uses an authentication system called Captive Portal La rete wireless Sapienza utilizza un sistema di autenticazione chiamato Captive Portal:
1. Connect to Wi-Fi "Sapienza"
2. A login window will automatically pop up
3. insert __your ID number (codice matricola)__ and __the password you use for Infostud__

You will be now able to use the connection freely!

Keep in mind that Sapienza Wi-Fi requires login every time you try to connect to it, a not so practical feature if you have to use it frequently. Therefore, it is suggested to use Eduroam Wi-Fi, that requires only one configuration.

## Eduroam Wi-Fi
__Eduroam__ (education roaming) is an international service of wireless roaming and it is, therefore, avaible in many academic institution around the world.
Crediantial for the access are __your personal Sapienza email (surname.id_number@studenti.uniroma1.it)__ and __the password you use for Infostud__.
