## NG1 Admission Requirements
A Bachelorâ€™s degree, or another suitable degree obtained abroad, is a requirement to be admitted to the Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science. Knowledge of key aspects of computer science concerning computer architecture, algorithms and data structures, programming languages, databases, computer networks, operating systems, and necessary mathematical tools is required. Graduates need to have earned at least 90 university credits in the following fields to access the Masterâ€™s Degree:
- INF/01
- ING-INF/01, ING-INF/02, ING-INF/03, ING-INF/04, ING-INF/05
- FIS/01, FIS/02, FIS/07
- MAT/01, MAT/02, MAT/03, MAT/05, MAT/06, MAT/07, MAT/08, MAT/09

Students who do not satisfy such requirements can enroll in single courses, as provided by the Regulations for Sapienza Students, and sit for the related exams before enrolling in the Masterâ€™s Degree. Students who do not yet possess a bachelorâ€™s degree can also enroll in the Masterâ€™s Degree as long as they graduate by the date indicated in the related regulations of that academic year. A good knowledge of both written and oral English is also required, at B2 or a higher level.

## NG2 Admission Test and Assessment of Requirements
Requirements will be assessed by a committee appointed by the Area Educational Board. The committee will automatically approve admission to the Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science for students who have earned at least 70 credits relating to INF/01 and/or ING/INF-05 disciplines. Students who do not possess the credits mentioned above will be interviewed by the committee to assess their knowledge.

## NG3 Transitions, Transfers, Degree Course Shortening, Credits Recognition

### NG3.1 Transitions and Transfers
Students enrolled in previous academic systems may transfer to the Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science. Applications are evaluated for credit recognition, and a completion plan is formulated. Transfers from other institutions are also subject to evaluation.

### NG3.2 Degree Course Shortening
Students who already possess a degree may apply to enroll in a year following the first in the Masterâ€™s program, based on credit recognition.

### NG3.3 Criteria for Credits Recognition
All earned credits, if related to courses coherent with one of the Masterâ€™s Degree study plans, can be recognized, provided they are documented by course syllabi. Credits from equivalent courses can be recognized after evaluation by the Area Educational Board.

## NG4 Completion Plans and Individual Study Plans

### NG4.1 Completion Plans
Students must select one of the curricula and choose courses accordingly. Completion plans must be approved by the Area Educational Board.

### NG4.2 Individual Study Plans
Students who do not adopt a completion plan must submit an individual study plan which will be evaluated for coherence with the chosen curriculum.

### NG4.3 Changes to Completion Plans and Individual Study Plans
Similar to the Bachelor's program, students may change their plans in subsequent years, but exams already recorded cannot be replaced.

## NG5 Teaching Methods
Didactic activities are spread across semesters and include lectures, seminars and laboratory workshops. The minimal duration of the degree program is four semesters (two years).

### NG5.1 ECTs
One ECT corresponds to 25 hours of student commitment. The total workload for the degree is 120 ECTs.

### NG5.2 Teaching Calendar
The teaching calendar is organized into two teaching periods and three exam periods. Specific schedules are provided [here](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/corso/2024/29932/programmazione).

### NG5.3 Exam Tests
Exams may include written, oral and autonomous work components, graded on a scale of 30.

## NG6 Attendance Methods, Propaedeutics, Progression to Subsequent Years
Attendance is recommended but not mandatory. The sequence of courses in the study plan indicates the optimal order for taking exams.

## NG7 Part-Time Regime
The terms and procedures for requesting the part-time regime as well as the related rules are set out in article 24 of the University study manifesto and can be consulted on the Sapienza website. It is possible to choose a number of CFU/year ranging from 18 to 45.

## NG8 Students Who Have Not Completed Their Course of Study and Validity of Acquired Credits
Pursuant to art. 32 of the University study manifesto, a student is considered to be behind schedule when, having attended all the training activities provided for in this teaching regulation, he or she has not passed all the exams and has not acquired the number of credits necessary to obtain the qualification within 3 years.
Pursuant to art. 33 of the University study manifesto: a full-time student who is behind schedule must pass the exams missing to complete his or her university career within 9 years of enrollment;
the part-time student who is behind schedule must pass the remaining tests to complete his/her university career within double the number of years foreseen by the choice of the duration of the part-time regime.
The CAD establishes that, in the event that the above terms are not respected, the validity of the credits acquired will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and may be considered acquired only for the basic courses. For reinstatement, students must in any case submit an appropriate application to the Student Administrative Office, within the timeframes and in the manner set out in the University Study Plan.

## NG9 Tutoring
Students can benefit from the tutoring activity carried out by the professors indicated by the CAD. The professors available as tutors and the tutoring methods will be advertised for each academic year by posting notices at the Teaching Office and on the degree course website.
The tutoring activity is divided into various individual and collective services and is governed by specific regulations that can be consulted on the degree course website.

## NG10 Honours Programmes
Students can participate in Honours Programmes when enrolling in the second year of the Master's program. More [here](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/corso/2024/29932/programmazione).

## NG11 Final Exam
The final exam involves submitting and discussing a written thesis, preferably in English, based on original research. The final grade is based on the studentâ€™s entire academic career, thesis, and final exam performance.

## NG12 Application of Art. 6 of the Student Regulations
Students can attend two courses and sit for the respective exams of other faculties to enrich their career. Only students who have earned at least 36 credits in the Master's Degree in Computer Science can apply.
